# CPU Usage Prediction

In this project, the data was imported from a csv file in google drive. The dataset contains different unspecified laptops/computers and its specifications and target usage.

The goal of the project was to predict whether a given set of laptop/computer specification is intended for gaming or office use. This was done through the following steps:

1. Cleaning of Null Values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Label Encoding
4. Splitting of data into Train and Test Datasets.
5. Creating the Artificial Neural Network Model using `Tensorflow`.
6. Evaluating the Model.
